[features]
# This feature adds stuff required for Jotoba to work but not necessarily for extern crates, so its made optional

# Contains API types, and can be used as rust wrapper around the Jotoba API
api = ["jotoba"]

# Contains all core-types which are used by Jotoba internally. This contains words, sentences, kanji and names
